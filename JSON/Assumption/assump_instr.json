  "description": "Compile all assumptions and constraints related to the project into an Assumption Log&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}. Use the project charter (and business case) to capture initial assumptions (factors believed true) and constraints (limitations). Each entry should have an ID, description, and status. Mark any unknown assumptions or constraints for review.",

    "goal": "Create a log of project assumptions and constraints based on the input documentation.",
    "steps": [
      "1. **Extract Assumptions**: Identify all assumptions stated or implied in the input (e.g. expected conditions, resource availability, external factors presumed true)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}. Record each assumption as a separate entry with a clear description. If the input does not explicitly provide assumptions, list major areas that likely have assumptions and mark them as `<MISSING_assumption> [Review]` (to be confirmed).",
      "2. **Extract Constraints**: Identify all constraints from the input â€“ these are limitations or restrictions (e.g. fixed deadlines, budget limits, regulatory requirements) that boundary the project&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}. Document each constraint with a description. If none are mentioned, include placeholders like `<MISSING_constraint> [Review]` for areas where constraints are expected.",
      "3. **Detail Each Entry**: For every assumption and constraint, include:\n   - a unique **ID** (e.g., A-1 for assumption 1, C-1 for constraint 1),\n   - a concise **description** of the assumption or constraint,\n   - and a **status** indicating its current state. (If not provided, default the status to \"Pending\" or \"Unconfirmed\" until validated.)",
      "4. **No Unjustified Assumptions**: Do not introduce new assumptions or constraints that are not supported by the input. Only include those that logically arise from the project context. If the project context is silent on assumptions or constraints, limit the output to placeholders rather than inventing specifics.",
      "5. **Traceability**: Ensure that each logged assumption or constraint can be traced back to a source (e.g., charter or business case section) if possible. Use comments in the description like '[Charter]' or similar if needed to indicate origin (or leave a note to review origin).",
      "6. **Format Output**: Return a JSON object with two arrays: one for `Assumptions` and one for `Constraints`. Each array element should be an object containing the id, description, and status."
