Describe the target benefits (tangible and intangible value expected) and how they align with organizational strategy. Specify the timeframe for realizing benefits&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:84]{index=84}, the benefits owner, and metrics to measure benefits&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:85]{index=85}. Note any assumptions and risks to benefit realization&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:86]{index=86}. Use placeholders for information not provided in the input.",

  "llm_prompt_instructions": {
    "goal": "Document how the project's benefits will be realized, measured, and sustained, in alignment with the business case.",
    "steps": [
      "1. **Target Benefits**: List the expected benefits of the project and their intended values&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:87]{index=87}. This includes both tangible benefits (e.g., cost savings of $X, revenue increase of Y%) and intangible benefits (e.g., improved customer satisfaction). Provide as much detail as available (e.g., specific numeric targets or qualitative outcomes). If the input does not specify, use `<MISSING_benefit>` to indicate unspecified benefit details.",
      "2. **Strategic Alignment**: Describe how these benefits align with the organization’s strategic goals or objectives&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:88]{index=88}. For example, explain which corporate strategy or business goal the project’s benefits support. If this information is not given, mark it as `<MISSING_strategicAlignment> [Review]`.",
      "3. **Timeframe for Benefits**: Indicate when the benefits are expected to be realized&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:89]{index=89}. This might include short-term vs. long-term designations, or specific time frames (e.g., \"Within 6 months of project completion\" or \"Ongoing yearly savings after launch\"). Separate different benefit timeframes if multiple benefits have different realization windows. Use placeholders for unknown timings.",
      "4. **Benefits Owner**: Identify the person or role responsible for ensuring each benefit is realized and sustained&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:90]{index=90}. This could be a department manager, product owner, sponsor, etc., who will take ownership after project closure. If not stated, include `<MISSING_owner>` or suggest a likely owner role (e.g., \"Sales Director\" for a sales increase benefit) marked as [Review].",
      "5. **Metrics**: Define how the achievement of each benefit will be measured&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:91]{index=91}. List quantifiable metrics or KPIs for each benefit (e.g., customer satisfaction score increase, percentage reduction in processing time, etc.). If metrics are not defined in the input, insert `<MISSING_metric>` for that benefit and flag it.",
      "6. **Assumptions**: Document any assumptions that must hold true for the benefits to be realized&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:92]{index=92}. For example, assumptions about market conditions, user adoption rates, or organizational changes. These assumptions might be drawn from the business case. If none are provided, note major implicit assumptions or put placeholders for future identification.",
      "7. **Risks**: List the main risks that could jeopardize the realization of the benefits&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:93]{index=93}. This could include things like market downturns, regulatory changes, or project output not meeting requirements. If the input identifies specific benefit-related risks, include them. Otherwise, list generic risks or `<MISSING_risk>` if not enough info, to be analyzed later.",
      "8. **Review & Update**: (Optional) Mention that this Benefits Management Plan should be reviewed at project milestones or post-project to track benefit realization and updated if assumptions or conditions change. This indicates the plan is a living document through benefits realization phase.",
      "9. Return the Benefits Management Plan as a JSON object with fields for TargetBenefits (array of benefit descriptions), StrategicAlignment (string), Timeframe (string or descriptive timeline), BenefitsOwner (string), Metrics (array), Assumptions (array), and Risks (array)."
