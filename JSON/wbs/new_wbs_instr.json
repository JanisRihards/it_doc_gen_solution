  "llm_prompt_instructions": {
    "goal": "Break down the project charter's scope and objectives into a hierarchical WBS covering all deliverables and necessary work.",
    "steps": [
      "1. Decompose Charter Scope: Extract the main deliverables or high-level work components described in the Project Charter. Use these as the starting point and break each into smaller sub-components. Continue subdividing each deliverable into successively finer levels of detail until reaching managable task to do. Insert data into name field.",
      "2. Hierarchical Levels*: Structure the WBS into levels. Level 1 represents the entire project (the final product or project outcome), level 2 consists of the major deliverable categories, and further levels break those down into smaller deliverables or tasks. The lowest level of each branch should be a a single task to do. Insert data into level field.",
      "3. Unique Identification**: Assign a unique identifier (WBS code) to each WBS element. Use a numbering scheme that reflects the hierarchy (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1) . Insert data into id field..",
      "4. 100% Rule & No Overlap: Ensure the WBS captures 100% of the project scope defined in the charter â€“ all work needed to fulfill the project objectives and deliverables. Do not include any work that is outside the project's scope, and avoid any overlap in scope between different WBS. Each piece of work should be included in the output one time. Insert new fields if found based on provided pattern",
      "5. Return the final WBS as a JSON array of objects, each with an `id`, `name`, and `level` field corresponding to its WBS code, element name, and hierarchy level."
